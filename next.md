# Next in Modern Tooling

The [Modern Tooling Project](http://w3c.github.io/modern-tooling/) is nearing the end of its first
phase, and I am leaving. This is a good time to look at the many ideas that were captured in the 
report, to figure out which of those are truly important, what that entails, and to look at what has
been developed with a view on upcoming development and maintenance of these new tools.

The approach of the initial document was to capture as much as possible in order to get a feel for 
the vast number of things that people would like to have, with a thin layer of prioritisation on 
top. The goal of this here document is on the contrary to only cover what I consider to be 
absolutely vital to cover. Anything not covered here is, in my humble opinion, not very important.
This document serves as a status checkpoint and suggested roadmap for the next steps, in a very
synthetic manner.

## New Modern Stuff

These are the things that have already been worked on, and that are planned to be finished by the 
end of August. By “finished” I mostly mean that they are up and operational; it does not mean that
no work on them will need to be done.

### GitHub Guide

A [Guide to Using GitHub with W3C](http://w3c.github.io/) is in the works. At this point it only has
a landing page, but I will be adding content in the coming days and weeks. After I've added content,
it ought to be usable but will certainly require some maintenance and the occasional addition.

This is *not* something that I would expect the systeam to take over.
