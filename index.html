        This document is meant to capture the state of the discussion about modernising the tooling
        that supports the making of W3C standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discussion is open to all. <a href="https://github.com/w3c/modern-tooling/">Pull requests</a>
        are welcome, and the discussion takes place in
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/modern-tooling/issues">the issues</a>.

        This is just informal work by an informal task force.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
      <p>
        W3C is a heavily tooled organisation. We did Web tools long before they became ubiquitous
        and our tooling has earned us two decades of praise — which is probably more than can be
        said for any other part of the organisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the Web has changed quite a fair bit since then. Today, tools abound. The Web is an
        application platform. Our users are happy using many third-party tools, and it is only
        natural that they will compare what they can find elsewhere to our offering, sometimes
        preferring other options.
      </p>
      <p>
        This causes problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Our users move their work to third-party tools, where the data they produce in developing
          specifications may be lost or locked up. GitHub is a primary example here.
        </li>
        <li>
          The work that groups carry out is becoming increasingly scattered across services, such
          that it is hard to track and hard to join. Issue tracking for instance is all over the
          place.
        </li>
        <li>
          Our tools, even when they work well and remain the preferred option, are starting to look
          old in both styling and interaction style. It is hard for our users to maintain the
          impression that they are building the Web of tomorrow while using tools that are clearly
          from the 90s. Some of our more recent users even find them hard to understand. A good
          example is WBS or the mailing list archives.
        </li>
        <li>
          Accumulation is hard to manage and makes content hard to find. The W3C Web site and the
          majority of its services are exposed essentially as one single entity. After twenty years
          of accretion, that makes it hard to evolve as was made obvious in the recent discussion
          about upgrading it all to HTTPS. The heavily granular usage of ACLs makes it essentially
          impossible to index. Finding things on the W3C Web site typically involves knowing someone
          with the URL equivalent of an eidetic memory and asking them where to go. This issue is
          further compounded by user-hostile URL policies (datedspace). A good example here would
          be trying to find the next-generation pubrules service.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We need an energetic rethink of the W3C’s tooling in order to stay relevant to our users.
        That is what this document endeavours to provide.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>The Plan</h2>
        <p>
          I expect to proceed as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Iterate over this document through
            <a href="https://github.com/w3c/modern-tooling/issues">issues</a> and
            <a href="https://github.com/w3c/modern-tooling/">pull requests</a>. All discussions are
            intended to be public.
          </li>
          <li>
            Go broad and assume it’s Christmas. I don't want to discourage input by having people
            think about constraints. It’s of course very likely that at the end we can’t get
            everything but that’s okay. We can easily prioritise later, but I don’t want to miss a
            good idea.
          </li>
          <li>
            Assume hackability. Even with the best and the pithiest involved in drafting this
            document it is a given that not everything that may be useful to some part of our
            community at some moment of the future will be thought of. We need to build to ensure
            that our users can refine and extend our work.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be particularly wary of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gal%C3%A1pagos_syndrome">Galápagos syndrome</a>.
            There is every reason for W3C to have its specificities, even its quirks, but they need
            to be usable and manageable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Target mid-April for a first draft for internal W3C discussion; then present an overview
            to the AC at its early May meeting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hopefully start implementing!
          </li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Tools &amp; Supporting Setup</h2>
      <p>
        This section is a categorised but unprioritised list of tools and services that W3C should
        deploy, as well as ideas on how to manage integration with third-party systems.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h2>Core Services</h2>
        <p>
          These are services that can be reused by other parts of the ecosystem.
        </p>
        
        <section>
          <h2>Single Sign-On</h2>
          <p>
            Many tools and services will expose features that are user-dependent. It is not
            appropriate for those to implement their own user database duplicating W3C’s. It would
            also be a shame if they had to make use of third-party sign-on infrastructure (which
            was the case with Discourse).
          </p>
          <p>
            Which exact solution is selected here is of relatively little importance, but it does
            need to support typical modern Web application authentication workflows. GitHub’s
            <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/">OAuth implementation</a> may provide a
            good example.
          </p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <h2>Search</h2>
          <p>
            The various tools to be developed may commonly require search functionality. Given the
            spread of W3C’s content, this can quickly become required. For instance, an Etherpad
            service might request indexing for its pads (using its own ACL knowledge), a chat
            logging service might index the logs, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            One potential candidate, that can double as a JSON document store and therefore be
            usable for application data storage, is <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elastic
            Search</a>.
